> Stipop provides a powerful and flexible sticker API that enables companies to add stickers onto their apps and websites with minimum effort and maximum effect.

Sticker is one of the most powerful visual contents you can find in the digital world. With more than 50 billion being sent everyday, it brings emotion into online communicaton. Unlike GIFs, because it has specific artist who created it with a purpose (for online communication, character etc.) it's very unique and usable. 

Seeing that sticker is a useful media, we as a team started a platform, where stickers and sticker lovers can play about. Our product began as an app for messenger users to download stickers for their personal use. Now that there is more than 2,000 sticker artists participating from 20 different countries and the total sticker accumulate to 100,000 we thought it best that other companies should be able to provide stickers to their own users.
